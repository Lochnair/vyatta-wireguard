help: Enable/disable sending RAs

# RFC-4861 default value is false, but since the router-advert tree is
# absent by default, that serves to meet the requirement that router
# adverts not be sent unless the system administrator explicitly configures
# the router to send them.  So, configuring router-advert and leaving
# this value unspecified serves to enable sending route adverts.

default: true
allowed: echo -n "true false"

val_help: true; Enable sending RAs
val_help: false; Disable sending RAs
